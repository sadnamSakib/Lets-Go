# Let-s-Go
This repository contains my learnings for each day about the fundamentals of the Go language.

## Day 1
- What is GO language?
    - Go is a procedural programming language. It was developed in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google but launched in 2009 as an open-source programming language.Programs are assembled by using packages, for efficient management of dependencies.It is a statically typed, concurrent and garbage-collected programming language.
- Inspiration
    - Modern programming languages are getting complicated each day. It seems such that the languages are taking features from each other and converging into a single language. But this convergence comes with the cost of complexity. Although it may seem like each feature is making it simpler to code but they are also adding the additional burden of complexity behind the scenes.As Rob pike describes it, "Bloat without distinction". Additionally, there are multiple ways to do the same thing. One developer might traverse through a loop in one way and another developer might do it in another way. This makes the code less readable for the develoeprs. Go's inspiration was to make a language that is simple, readable and easy to maintain.
